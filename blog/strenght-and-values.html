        <h1>Strengths and values</h1>
        <p>
          I am actually a resonably shy and intorverted human but, I think this
          is what makes me a really good listener. Listening is one of my
          strengths. I'm that kinda person that will listen to others for ages,
          my gentle nature making me the kind of person that listens without
          judging and that is where my values of trust, honesty and integrity
          come to life. Trust and integrity are two of my most important values
          in life. I beleive these values create the foundations for authentic
          friendships and relationships in life.
