      <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to manage your own emotions and be
        aware of the emotions of others around you. from a very young age we are
        learning to develop our emotional intelligence through the trials and
        tribulations of our toddlerism, not sure if that's an official name for
        that period in our lives but it comes with so many challenges which,
        mean that from a really early age we are navigating emotional
        intelligence by learning to regulate our emotions and show empathy. To
        build our emotional intelligence we need to be able to understand our
        own emotions in positive ways, the emotions of others and show empathy.

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        Eq - emotional quotient, is a measurement of your emotional
        intelligence. It measures your ability to regulate your emotions,
        ability to self motivate, communicate emotions and recogise emotions in
        others. However, IQ - intelligence quotient measure your capability to
        learn, understand and apply knowledge to everyday tasks. Some aspects
        taken into consideration when measuring IQ are, how well you are able to
        think logically, communicate, problem solve and comprehend information.

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is important because it supports us in acheiving
        our goals and building relationships. Emotional intelligence allows us
        to understand a range of feelings as we move through our lives and
        supports us to respond to events in our environments including family,
        work and the world.
