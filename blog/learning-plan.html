      <title>Learning plan</title>

      <div>
        <h1>Learning plan</h1>
        <p>
          My short term goal is to be successfull and graduate this programme so
          that my long term goal of becoming a game developer can become a
          reality. However, i am open to all career opurtunities that can
          support my growing knowledge of coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          My strengths for learning are that i dont want to give up, i want to
          learn as much as i can and gain a qualification. My ability to learn
          is sometimes challenged by mild dyslexia and being introverted i find
          it difficult to communicate for support.
        </p>
        <p>
          The personal skills i would like to develop within myself are self
          confidence and the confidence to be able to communicate openly and
          expresively to others and feel more comfortable in social situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am commited to the workload in this programme and will do my best to
          work as efficiently as possible, meet due dates and take care of my
          personal wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To work productively with others i will communicate as clearly as
          possible, respect others opinions and thoughts. I will take
          accountability for my contributions toward projects and manage my time
          efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will seek help when needed by reaching out to facilitators and group
          members using discord, email and face to face conversation. i expexct
          the facilitators to be availabe to support me when requested, to find
          solutions, to guide my learning and make me feel welcome.
