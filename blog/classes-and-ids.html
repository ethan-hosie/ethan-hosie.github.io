      <h1>Classes and ids</h1>

      <h2>What is a class?</h2>
      <p>
        A class is a selector that allows a developer to select a group of
        elements using the same class name and apply styles to it. The class
        selector is written with a period followed by the class name.
      </p>
      <img class="img" src="\class-selector.png" />

      <h2>What is an id?</h2>
      <p>
        An id is used to select a single element within the code and need to be
        unique to each element. The id selector is written with a # followed by
        the id name.
      </p>
      <img class="img" src="\id-selector.png" />

      <h2>Which should you use?</h2>
      <p>
        You can use whichever one you want as they do the same thing, but you
        should use id's for specific elements that you want to apply a certian
        style to.
